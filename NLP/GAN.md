# GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS

whilist AI can analyze photos and images using Convolutional Neural Networks, it can also generate imaginary images.

computer generated images loooks like they had been taken real-life but not.

One way of generating computer-images is by pitting two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against each other in a “contest” called a generative adversarial network, or GAN. In effect, the CNNs battle each other until one of them becomes pretty good at creating art.

one CNN would act as a generator and the other would act as Discriminator
