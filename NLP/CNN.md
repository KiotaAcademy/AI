# CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS

AI uses convolutional neural networks to analyze images

Digital photos and videos build images with millions of pixelsâ€”tiny dots that, taken together, give the human eye the illusion of a two-dimensional image

CNN, makes it possible for visual recognition systems to identify things in an image, as in facial recognition.

In a CNN, two small groups of pixels that overlap each other are compared mathematically to get a value. AI can use thousands of these small comparisons to identify individual parts of an image, then compare them to images in its corpus. From this, AI can put together an overall identification, without being overwhelmed.
