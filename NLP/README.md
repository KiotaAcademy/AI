# NLP

at the base level, the cognitive system:

1. understands
2. Reasons
3. Learn
4. Interact

## NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

human language is unstructured, for computers to understand human language, it has to do what we call `sentence segmentation`.

it further breaks the information into chunks of information called `tokens`, that can be individually classified.

Once the tokens in text have been sorted into a structure based on what they mean, NLP can work with them.

words can be tokenized into entities and relationships

### ENTITIES

An entity is a noun representing a person, place, or thing. Itâ€™s not an adjective, verb, or other article of speech

### RELATIONSHIP

A relationship is a group of two or more entities that have a strong connection to one another.

Once an AI has classified entities and relationships in text or speech, the AI can begin structuring the information as a step toward understanding it. Your brain, by the way, does the same thing, which might have helped you find entities and relationships in the previous activities.

### CONCEPT

A concept is something implied in a sentence but not actually stated. This is trickier because it involves matching ideas rather than the specific words present in the sentence.

## EMOTION DETECTIOM

identifies distinct human emotion types.

For example, you can determine if the emotion being expressed is anger, happiness, or fear after reading a user's rating and comments in an online customer satisfaction survey.

AI can be trained to classify emotions.

## SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

it is the measure of strength of an emotion.

You can think of sentiment as a sliding scale between positive and negative, with neutral in the middle.

Sentiment analysis is a means of assessing if data is positive, negative, or neutral.

## CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM

here is where in our day to day conversations we can have different meaning under the same conversation.

NLP combines techniques from computer science, linguistics, and machine learning to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way.
