# MACHINE LEARNING

Machine learning and probabilistic calculations

there are two types of computing:

1. classical - which is deterministic
2. Machine learning - which is probabilistic

machine learning solves problems in three different ways:

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning

## A Determistic System

there must be an enormous, predetermined structure of routes—a gigantic database of possibilities from which the machine can make its choice. If a certain route leads to the destination, then the machine flags it as “YES”. If not, it flags it as “NO”. This is basically binary thinking: on or off, yes or no.

## A Probabilistic System

It never says “YES” or “NO”. Machine learning is analog (like waves gradually going up and down) rather than binary (like arrows pointing upward and downward). Machine learning constructs every possible route to a destination and compares them in real time, including all the variables such as changing traffic. So, a machine learning system doesn’t say, “This is the fastest route.” It says something like, “I am 84% confident that this route will get you there in the shortest time.”

to make a perfect decision, we need to rely on both machine and human strengths. A partnership between humans and machines can lead to sensible decisions.

## Supervised Learning (STRUCTURED DATA)

here you provide AI with enough information to make accurate predictions

All supervised learning require labelled data - This is a set of facts and figures arranged into neat, labeled categories, the way you might put weather information into a table.

in supervised learning you need to tell your model:

1. this key characteristics called features
2. what this thing actually is - the ones that you are identifying features for.

structured data can take many forms:

1. images
2. entries in an excel sheet

machines can learn alot of things from those images from the way those pixels are arranged.

## Unsupervised Learning

a person feeds a machine a large amount of information, asks a question, and then the machine is left to figure out how to answer the question by itself.

For example, the machine might be fed many photos and articles about dogs. It will classify and cluster information about all of them. When shown a new photo of a dog, the machine can identify the photo as a dog, with reasonable accuracy.

imagine you work for a banking institution and you have a large set of customer financial data. You don't know what type of groups or categories to organize the data. Here, an unsupervised learning algorithm could find natural groupings of similar customers in a database, and then you could describe and label them

a system might be fed many articles about different kinds of plants and form its own conclusions of their attributes. When the system ingests new text describing a plant, it identifies it and gives it a confidence value.

## Reinforcement learning

This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes is reinforced to develop the best recommendation for a given problem. The foundation of reinforcement learning is rewarding the “right” behavior and punishing the “wrong” behavior.

As a machine learns through trial and error, it tries a prediction, then compares it with data in its corpus:

1. Each time the comparison is positive, the machine receives positive numerical feedback, or a reward.
2. Each time the comparison is negative, the machine receives negative numerical feedback, or a penalty.

Here a machine is not given any specific infromation to ingest the data, The machine learning algorithm is rewarded when it performs a correct action and penalized when it doesn't.

After these penalties and rewards happen many times, the machine’s answers become more accurate and its confidence value grows higher.
