# CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING

this began in 1950, AI learned by ingesting data and getting better at recognizing patterns.

this data ingestion and getting better in recognizing patterns depends on algorithms

Algorithms are just mathematical functions or expressions that output results.

typical machines used for classical computing include:

1. Decision Tree
2. Linear regression
3. logistic regression

## Decision Tree

this is a supervised Machine learning algorithm, it operates like a flow chart

classical machines start with known data.

## Linear regression

It relates to data that might be graphed as a straight line. For example, a business might believe that more advertising spending leads to better sales. This could be graphed as a series of dots that form a rising straight line

Linear regression can learn all the variables, then calculate a reasonably accurate prediction of how advertising will impact sales at some time and location in the future

## Logistic regression

In some situations, a relationship does not fall in a straight line. Sometimes a system uses values that require a specific, limited kind of outcome, such as something between 0 and 1 (or NO and YES). In this situation, a graph can form whatâ€™s called a sigmoid function, or an S-shaped curve
