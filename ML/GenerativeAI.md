# Generative AI

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful and exciting type of AI that generates new, original content, such as images, music, videos, data, code, responses to questions

Most AI systems are discriminative AI models, which predict and classify data.

In contrast, generative AI models are a type of deep learning AI system that uses algorithms to generate content based on a submitted prompt, thus the name of generative AI.

So, generative AIâ€™s distinction from other AI systems is its ability to produce content that is new and considered creative, such as images, videos, music, synthetic data, essays, answers to questions, and more.

## TYPES OF GENERATIVE AI MODELS

1. Variational autoencoder (VAE)
2. Generative adversarial Network (GAN)
3. Autoregressive

## VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER

Think of variational autoencoder (VAE) models as a skilled artist who can look at a painting, quickly sketch a simplified version of it, and then recreate a new painting using only that simplified sketch as a reference. The artist is capturing the essential elements of the painting and then using them to create a new work of art.

VAEs use a similar process. The "encoder" network compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation and the "decoder" network reconstructs the original data from this compressed representation. This allows VAEs to capture the underlying structure and patterns in the data, which can then generate new, similar data.

## GENERATIVE ADVERSARY NETWORK

Think of a generative adversarial network (GAN) model as a competition between a skilled forger (the generator) and a talented art critic (the discriminator). The forger creates fake paintings, while the critic tries to determine whether each painting is genuine or a forgery. As the forger improves their technique, the critic becomes more discerning, and this cycle continues until the forger can create near-perfect forgeries.

In GANs, the generator creates new data, while the discriminator evaluates the quality of the generated data. The generator tries to create data that is realistic enough to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to better distinguish between real and generated data. This competition leads to the generator creating increasingly realistic content.

## AUTOREGRESSIVE

Imagine an autoregressive model as a skilled storyteller who listens to the beginning of a story and then continues it by predicting what comes next based on the words and events that have occurred so far. The storyteller uses their knowledge of language, grammar, and storytelling conventions to create a coherent and engaging continuation of the story.
