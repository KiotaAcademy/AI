# MACHINE LEARNING

three terms:

1. Artificial intelligence - describes computer systems that can apply reasoning to subjects that previously require human intelligence.
2. Machine learning - it represents machine or systems to predict and classify given data in response to ever-changing data, somewhat like the way you learn from experience.
3. Deep Learning -  a group of extremely powerful types of machine learning, many of which are inspired by the operation of neural networks in the human brain.

Machines don't have a sense of the world and a sense of self, at least not yet, what they do is just they can learn and gain understanding, they can acquire knowledge,  this process called `cognition`.

cognition is accomplishing results that resembles human thinking

they do this primarily using algorithms that enables them to analyze data.
