Machine learning is, in the end, about making predictions using statistics and calculus; both of which are used in bits of code called machine learning algorithms.

These bits of code, in turn, can be organized in large-scale computer programs called machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

special type of functions/ programming functions that identify patterns

## Machine Learning Models

A group of this machine learning algorithms that operate together and collaborate together

How is this different from the way conventional computer programs operate? A machine learning model doesn’t depend only on a human to write its code or to adjust its programming if its predictions aren’t right. Instead, a machine learning model can reprogram itself. So if, for example, a weather model tends to get a certain type of prediction wrong, it can adjust its algorithms
