# FAIRNESS

AI can cause harm, not only physical harm, but also harm in form of inequity, discrimination or exclusion

fairness is equitable treatment of individuals or group of individuals

this is achieved when unwanted bias is mitigated

bias is a systematic error that has been designed, intentionally or not, in a way that might generate unfair decisions.

Bias can be present in the AI system, in the data used to train and test the system, or even in both.

Bias can emerge in an AI system because of cultural expectations, technical limitations, or unanticipated deployment contexts.
