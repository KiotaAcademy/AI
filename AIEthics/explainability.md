# EXPLAINABILITY

An AI system is explainable when everyday people, who do not have any special training in AI, can understand how and why the system came to a particular prediction or recommendation.

Explainability is like showing your work on a math problem so that everyone can see the steps you took to get your answer.

## INTERPRATABILITY
